NOTE: CentOS 6.8 X64 has a low kernel version and therefore not supported inotify function built-in by gdnsd. 
Hence we choose Debian 8.X x64 as our prod OS.

Debian Jessie has been shipped with gdnsd 2.1.2-1~deb8u1 which is older than current release. Build from source is our best choice.

The whole installation has been tested on DigitalOcean VPS.
